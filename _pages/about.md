I am a Computer Science graduate student at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. I use experimentation, hypothesis testing, and machine learning techniques to build intelligent systems.

<!-- I'm extremely interested in the intersection of software engineering and machine learning,  -->

<!-- Most of my work is on GitHub. Here are some of my projects:
- [EDOL](): Calculating engagement in online learning using TensorFlow and OpenFace
- [Handy Py](): A collection of python snippets that I have written over the years to make my life easier for interviews and programming puzzles.
- [Handy ML](): A last minute cheat sheet for machine learning interviews. -->


Iâ€™m best reached via email. Always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
