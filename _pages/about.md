I am currently a second-year graduate student at Northeastern University, where I am majoring in Computer Science and Machine Learning. I aim to use experimentation, hypothesis testing, and machine learning techniques to build intelligent systems.

Recently I've been very interested in causality, and interpretability in deep neural networks.

Iâ€™m best reached via email and I am always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
